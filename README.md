##Backend choices

For the backend I decided to work with Express, MongoDB and Sqlite3. The biggest reason for choosing Express is because I felt comfortable working with that for the reason that we have used it multiple times before in other courses, aswell as having used it in this course. So alot of the code used for the assignments prior to the project could then be reused with minor changes to them.

I then decided to use Sqlite3 for the registration and login just because I already had all the code for that from prior assignments so that was just mostly copy and paste. For the rest of the backend I used MongoDB because I wanted to learn more about that than just having worked with it in one assignment, aswell as it felt really nice for the uses that I wanted.

##Frontend choices

I decided to go with React for this project, mostly for the reason that I have worked with it quite alot before in the groupproject beforehand, so I felt quite comfortable with it. I decided to work with classes for this project rather the "funtional" React which might have made some things easier but I didn't feel like I had that much time to learn how to work with React that way for this project.

##Realtime choices

For the realtime functionalities of the project I choose to work with Socket.IO which we used in a earlier assignment. I wouldn't say that I was very comfortable with it anyway but I tried my best to make it work. The realtime functionalitie works with the price of items, which increase for all clients when the are clicked in on a item. I also tried to make it work with my graphs but I never managed to get the graph to update when it got new data, it might be because the way i display my graphs isn't the most optimal way and I felt like it made it really hard, but I didn't really have the time to change the entire way of how I want my graphs to be displayed.
